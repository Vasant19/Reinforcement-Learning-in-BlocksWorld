# üß† Blocks World RL Agents
[Screencast from 2025-06-23 15-06-15.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7da4cdcf-dc15-444c-bc8c-c4c6af080afa)

This project implements Reinforcement Learning agents to solve the classic **Blocks World** environment using:

- **Q-Learning** (Tabular)
- **DQN** (Deep Q-Networks)
- **PPO** (Proximal Policy Optimization)

Agents learn to rearrange blocks to match goal configurations, navigating a symbolic planning space integrated with logic-based rules from Prolog.

## üöÄ Overview

**Blocks World** is a simplified environment often used in AI for symbolic reasoning and planning. Here, we integrate it with Gym-style RL interfaces, allowing deep RL agents to train and learn efficiently.
